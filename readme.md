## About CompanionCloud

CompanionCloud is a web application that can be used as an order tracking tool in which a pet crematory can utilize to process cremation orders. This is a substitution for a paper-based order processing that can be difficult to manage throughout an order. CompanionCloud has features that enables clinics to process pet cremations in a simple and fast manner. The messaging center enables clinics to instantly message the cremation facility of any updates on an order and can immediately change or add to the order. Clinics can add a new pet to the system with custom options for the order and then they can print out a barcode for the order to place on the cadaver bag of the pet. Clinics and pet owners can then track the status of their pet or order and will be notified via sms once the pet is finished and ready for pickup at the vet clinic.
